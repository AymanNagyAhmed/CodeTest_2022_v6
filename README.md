## Task
### 1- I assume that these files are in laravel project not in the package

### 2- How would you have done it?
  ```
  Change the namespace, trace the functions, and fix some return values according to documentation comments
  ```

### 3- Thoughts on formatting, structure, and logic?
  ```
  This structure missing interfaces to defining repository contracts:

   |—— refactor
   |    |—— app
   |        |—— Http
   |            |—— Controllers
   |                |—— BookingController.php
   |                |—— Controller.php
   |        |—— Repository
   |            |—— BaseRepository.php
   |            |—— BookingRepository.php

  ```

  ```
 Repository Design Pattern:

│
├── Repositories  // Repository classes for data access logic
│   ├── UserRepository.php
│   ├── BookingRepository.php
│
├── Interfaces   // Interfaces defining repository contracts
      ├── UserRepositoryInterface.php
      ├── BookingRepositoryInterface.php

  ```


### 4- what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it?

 #### Good Aspects:

 - Separation of Concerns: This structure partially separates concerns by moving repositories out of controllers.
 - This can improve maintainability as data access logic is grouped.
 - Code Organization: It groups repositories in a dedicated Repository folder, which is a good practice for larger projects.

 #### Not-So-Good Aspects:
 - Limited Separation: While repositories are separated, controllers might still contain data access logic if not using the repository methods. This can reduce the benefits of the Repository pattern.
 - Missing Interfaces: Interfaces are a crucial part of the Repository pattern. They define the contract for repositories, promoting loose coupling and testability. This structure lacks the Interfaces folder.



 ### 5- I prefer the Service-Controller design pattern in Laravel. and if i make a rest-full API I prefer to use a global response shape

  ```
 app/
├── Models
│   ├── User.php
│   ├── Booking.php
│   └── ... (other models)
├── Services    // Service classes for encapsulating business logic
│   ├── UserService.php
│   ├── BookingService.php
│   └── ... (other services)
└── Http
      ├── Controllers  // Controllers handling application logic and responses
      │   ├── BookingController.php
      │   

  ```
